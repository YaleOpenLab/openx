// the contractor super struct comprises of various entities within it. Its a

// well

	// the name of the contractor / company that is contracting
	// A contractor is party who proposes a specific some of money towards a
	// particular project. This is the actual amount that the investors invest in.
	// This ideally must include the developer fee within it, so that investors
	// don't have to invest in two things. It would also make sense because the contractors
	// sometimes would hire developers themselves.
	Contractor bool
	// A guarantor is somebody who can assure investors that the school will get paid
	// on time. This authority should be trusted and either should be vetted by the law
	// or have a multisig paying out to the investors beyond a certain timeline if they
	// don't get paid by the school. This way, the guarantor can be anonymous, like the
	// nice Pineapple Fund guy. This can also be an insurance company, who is willing to
	// guarantee for specific school and the school can pay him out of chain / have
	// that as fee within the contract the originator
	Developer bool
	// A developer is someone who installs the required equipment (Raspberry Pi,
	// network adapters, anti tamper installations and similar) In the initial
	// projects, this will be us, since we'd be installign the pi ourselves, but in
	// the future, we expect third party developers / companies to do this for us
	// and act in a decentralized fashion. This money can either be paid out of chain
	// in fiat or can be a portion of the funds the investors chooses to invest in.
	// a contractor may also employ developers by himself, so this entity is not
	// strictly necessary.
	Originator bool
	// An Originator is an entity that will start a project and get a fixed fee for
	// rendering its service. An Originator's role is not restricted, the originator
	// can also be the developer, contractor or guarantor. The originator should take
	// the responsibility of auditing the requirements of the project - panel size,
	// location, number of panels needed, etc. He then should ideally be able to fill
	// out some kind of form on the website so that the originator's proposal is live
	// and shown to potential investors. The originators get paid only when the project
	// is live, else they can just spam, without any actual investment
	Guarantor bool
	// A Guarantor is someone who can vouch for the recipient and fill in for them
	// in case they default on payment. They can c harge a fee and this must be
	// put inside the contract itself.
	PastContracts []SolarProject
	// list of all the contracts that the contractor has won in the past
	ProposedContracts []SolarProject
	// the Originator proposes a contract which will then be taken up
	// by a contractor, who publishes his own copy of the proposed contract
	// which will be the set of contracts that will be sent to auction
	PresentContracts []SolarProject
	// list of all contracts that the contractor is presently undertaking1
	PastFeedback []Feedback
	// feedback received on the contractor from parties involved in the past
	// What kind of proof do we want from the company? KYC?
	// maybe we could have a photo op like exchanges do these days, with the owner
	// holding up his drivers' license or similar
